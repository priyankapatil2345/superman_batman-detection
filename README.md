# Aim and Objectives
## Aim
To create a Helmet detection system which will detect Human head and then check if Helmet is worn or not.

## Objectives
• The main objective of the project is to create a program which can be either run on Jetson nano or any pc with YOLOv5 installed and start detecting using the camera module on the device.

• Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.

• To show on the optical viewfinder of the camera module whether a person is wearing a helmet or not.

## Abstract
• A person’s head is classified whether a helmet is worn or not and is detected by the live feed from the system’s camera.

• We have completed this project on jetson nano which is a very small computational device.

• A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.

• One such technique is to use YOLOv5 with Roboflow model, which generates a small size trained model and makes ML integration easier.

• A helmet is by far the most important and effective piece of protective equipment a person on a motorcycle can wear. Helmets save lives by reducing the extent of head injuries in the event of a traffic accidents.

• In a personal injury action brought by an injured motorcyclist, the opposing motorist may raise an issue regarding the motorcyclist's own negligence.

## Introduction
• This project is based on a Helmet detection model with modifications. We are going to implement this project with Machine Learning and this project can be even run on jetson nano which we have done.

• This project can also be used to gather information about who is wearing a helmet and who is not.

• Helmets worn can further be classified into Safety helmets for Construction workers, helmets for Bicycle riders and helmets for Motorcycle riders based on the image annotation we give in roboflow. 

• Helmet detection sometimes become difficult as safety helmets which don’t cover up chin and caps worn by people are of the same shape and size also sometimes the helmets worn by motorcyclists comes in variety of shapes and sizes with features like chin guard able to freely move above the head part thereby making helmet detection difficult. However, training in Roboflow has allowed us to crop images and change the contrast of certain images to match the time of day for better recognition by the model.

• Neural networks and machine learning have been used for these tasks and have obtained good results.

• Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very useful in pattern recognition and classification, and hence can be used for Helmet detection as well.

## Literature Review
• Wearing a helmet helps to reduce the impact of an accident on your head. While riding your two-wheeler, it is very likely that if you are involved in an accident, then the resulting head injuries can be fatal, if you are not wearing a helmet. 

• A full-faced helmet covers your entire face, providing you the complete protection in case you go through an accident. This type of helmet protects your eyes from dust and high beam lights when driving your two-wheeler.

• It is observed that wearing a helmet improves your attention while riding your bike. You tend to be more cautious and control your speed when wearing a helmet while driving your two-wheeler.

• Wearing a helmet not only covers your head but also covers your ears. This layer of safety blocks the cool breeze and rainy water to enter your ears and thus helps you to stay healthy & prevent you from getting sick in the cold and rainy weather.

• The significance of a helmet is all the more germane as the roads are heavily flooded with speeding vehicles and the chances of being in an accident are very high. Also, the patch works, and continuous development of the Indian roads increase the chances of accidents.

• A motorcyclist's legal recovery might be barred, or reduced, as a result of his/her contributory negligence in causing the accident.

• Mandatory helmet laws for motorcycle operators and their passengers have, for the most part, proven to be an effective strategy in both increasing helmet use and reducing head injuries and fatalities in motorcycle accidents nationwide. But, while having an unmistakably positive effect on the overall safety of motorcycle riding, helmet laws have been met by resistance in the motorcycling community.

## Jetson Nano Compatibility
• The power of modern AI is now available for makers, learners, and embedded developers everywhere.

• NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts.

• Hence due to ease of process as well as reduced cost of implementation we have used Jetson nano for model detection and training.

• NVIDIA JetPack SDK is the most comprehensive solution for building end-to-end accelerated AI applications. All Jetson modules and developer kits are supported by JetPack SDK.

• In our model we have used JetPack version 4.6 which is the latest production release and supports all Jetson modules.
